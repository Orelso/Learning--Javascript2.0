// Here is a list of some handy comparison operators and their syntax:

// Less than: <
// Greater than: >
// Less than or equal to: <=
// Greater than or equal to: >=
// Is equal to: ===
// Is not equal to: !==

// It can be helpful to think of comparison statements as questions. When the 
// answer is “yes”, the statement evaluates to true, and when the answer is “no”,
// the statement evaluates to false.
